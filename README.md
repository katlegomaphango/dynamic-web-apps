# DWA Part 1: Structuring JavaScript (2023) Projects

## Course Description:

In Part 1 of this course, **Structuring JavaScript**, we teach students how to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code in JavaScript. The content covers various areas of JavaScript development, including code style, documentation, error handling, abstraction, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and state machines, teaching students the skills and knowledge they need to structure their code in a way that makes it easy to manage and maintain.


### Structuring JavaScript Learning objectives:

- Understand strategies for managing complexity and structuring code to make it more maintainable.

- Learn about the origins of JavaScript and how the language is standardised and developed further.

- Understand the value of documentation and how different kinds of documentation are used in a project. 

- Understand how a consistent code style makes code easier to read and maintain and discover tools for efficiently implementing these conventions.

- Learn how to generate errors in your JavaScript to make your code more maintainable and expandable.

- Develop an understanding of how abstraction highlights the crucial features of code to developers while hiding the details.

- Understand the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it contributes to code modularity and maintainability.

- Learn the principles of encapsulation and how to write more secure code.

- Understand the principles of polymorphism and inheritance and how to use them to share code between related object classes.

- Develop an understanding of functional programming concepts, including purity and immutability, and how to use higher-order functions to transform data.

- Learn how to create state machines to model complex systems.

- Practice writing clean code through hands-on coding exercises and examples.

### By the end of the course, students will:

- be able to write JavaScript code that is modular, maintainable, and scalable, and they will have the skills to tackle complex coding challenges with confidence.
